# Workflow 0.1: Installations

## Step 1:  Access to Terminal 
- Mac:  Use the **Terminal** app or **iTerm**
- Windows: The standard Windows command prompt **does not work** for this workshop as it's a different shell. I suggest using Git Bash (can be installed when installing Git for Windows, **see below**).
- Linux: Use the Terminal

## Step 2:  Install Git
- Mac:  
	- [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
- Windows:  
	- [Git for Windows (comes with Git Bash)](https://gitforwindows.org/)
- Confirm Git is installed by typing `git --version` on your terminal

## Step 3:  Sign up for a GitHub account
- Register at [github.com](https://github.com/) if you haven't yet
- **Save your user ID and password somewhere you can easily find it**
- **If you already have a GitHub account, make sure you have access to your username and password**

## Step 4:  Choose a simple text editor
- We just need to edit a little bit of text. You can use your favorite text editor, or use one of the following:
	* [Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
 	* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
 	* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (for Windows)

**Once this workflow is complete, you can optionally proceed to Workflow 0.2 to configure your SSH keys for GitHub authentication.**
