### About This Workshop

Git is the most widely used modern version control system in the world today. GitHub has quickly become one of the key tools for hosting Git repositories, and has quickly become an important collaboration platform for open source development. In this workshop, you will learn the basics of version control with Git and GitHub. We will cover
- Some basic theory behind the version control tool git
- Creating a new repository
- Making new commits
- Creating branches and pull requests
- Forking repositories

There are no pre-requisites for learners, but some basic knowledge of shell commands will be helpful.

**Note:** This workshop teaches you the basic workflows to interact with Git. We won't cover a lot of theory or "what's going on behind the scenes". In order to become fluent in Git and deal with merge conflicts and other complex workflows, you should read up on the inner workings. I recommend ["How Does Git Actually Work?"](https://www.raywenderlich.com/books/advanced-git/v1.0/chapters/1-how-does-git-actually-work).
